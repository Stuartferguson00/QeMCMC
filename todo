# TODO:

## Priority

-   **Implement Qiskit Circuit Builder:** Modify `CircuitMaker` base class to fully implement gates, circuit building and time evolution.

## Code Cleanup & Refactoring

-   **Archive Qulacs Code and `CircuitMaker_old_qq.py`:**

    -   Move current Qulacs-based `CircuitMakerBase` to an `archive/` folder or a separate qulacs branch.

-   **Unify `CircuitMaker`:**
    -   Once the new Qiskit `CircuitMaker` is complete and tested, make it the main `CircuitMaker` for the project.
    -   Deprecate `CircuitMakerIsing` class, as the new generic builder makes it redundant.

## Testing

-   Update the `test_energy_equivalence` script to use new Qiskit `CircuitMaker` Hamiltonian.
-   Add new tests to verify structure of the auto-generated Qiskit circuits (e.g., check gate counts for a known `h` and `J` input).
-   Add a test to confirm the circuit builder correctly handles both symmetric and upper-triangular `J` matrices (i.e., by ignoring the lower triangle).
